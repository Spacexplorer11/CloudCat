# Cloud Cat

## What is CloudCat?

CloudCat is a remix of the iconic chrome dinosaur game, which chrome shows when you are offline.  
However CloudCat instead is a game where you play as a cat strolling along.  
Some devious **rainclouds** are trying to rain on your parade, and you must use your umbrella to protect yourself to
keep your fur dry!

## Why did I make it?

I made this game to have some fun, and to learn Rust! It is my first ever rust project (that I started), so don't expect it to be
perfect.  
It's made using Macroquad, a game library for Rust, and is heavily inspired by the original chrome dinosaur game.

## How do I play?

You can download the [latest release](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/CloudCat/releases/latest) for your OS or [play it in your browser](https://cloudcat.akaalroop.com)!
Press `Space` or click/tap the screen to activate the umbrella, and that's all you need to do!  
Your highscore is automatically saved/loaded.  
>[!CAUTION]
> Your highscore is only saved when your game is over and you've reached the game over screen
> **NOT** when quitting at any point.

## AI transparency
- Minimal (5-10%) AI was used in the actual gameplay and screens.
- **NO (0%)** AI was used in the game assets (cat, cloud, umbrella), I'm very proud of myself to have hand-drawn and hand-animated them! :)
- **Very Heavy (90%)** AI was used to allow me to deploy this game to the web since idk a thing abt that or WebGL.
- **Full (100%)** AI is used in Release Notes since those are auto-generated by Gemini

Overall, I'm proud to say that in the actual gameplay, concept and art, very little AI was used!
