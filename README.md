# Cloud Cat

## What is CloudCat?

CloudCat is a remix of the iconic chrome dinosaur game, which chrome shows when you are offline.  
However CloudCat instead is a game where you play as a cat strolling along.  
Some devious **rainclouds** are trying to rain on your parade, and you must use your umbrella to protect yourself to
keep your fur dry!

## Why did I make it?

I made this game to have some fun, and to learn Rust! It is my first ever rust project (that I started), so don't expect it to be
perfect.  
It's made using Macroquad, a game library for Rust, and is heavily inspired by the original chrome dinosaur game.

## How do I play?

You just download the [latest release](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/CloudCat/releases/latest) for your OS, or [play it in your browser](https://spacexplorer11.github.io/CloudCat/)!
Just press `Space` on your keyboard or click/tap the screen to activate the umbrella, and thats all you need to do!  
Your highscore is automatically saved/loaded.
