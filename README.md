# Cloud Cat

## What is CloudCat?

CloudCat is a remix of the iconic chrome dinosaur game, which chrome shows when you are offline.  
However CloudCat instead is a game where you play as a cat strolling along.  
Some devious **rainclouds** are trying to rain on your parade, and you must use your umbrella to protect yourself to
keep your fur dry!

## Why did I make it?

I made this game to have some fun, and to learn Rust! It is my first ever rust project, so don't expect it to be
perfect.  
It's made using Bevy, a game engine for Rust, and is heavily inspired by the original chrome dinosaur game.

## How do I play?

I haven't even made it yet so uhh, come back later and it should be made soonâ„¢.  
Exact date: Before Sep 2025. 100% guaranteed
